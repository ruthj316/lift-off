Codeing is the way of future education worldwide.

It is a unique way to communicate ideas and creative vision into
a visually and easily adjustable package.

The most attractive thing about codeing, is it is a language that can be adapted to suit all people of all ages and abilities throughout the whole world..

It is an exciting, fascinating and inspiring form of creative expression.

I recommend trying it to see that it is challenging and satisfying.

It costs nothing to be involved other than time, dedication, patience and commitment.

There is no need to be concerned about making errors or failing, there is no wasted materials!!

If you don't get it right, you can easily rectify your projects, have time out to rethink the problem, then come back to it in your own time.

There are many talented people of every age and ability that you can learn from.

They will help you learn and grow with thousands of tutorials and easily understandable step by step instructions.

There are dedicated and successful people to assist you with your projects, help you with problems, encourage you, support you and give you the confidence to better yourself.

We all make mistakes it is how we learn to do better.

The only mistake that you can make in life, is giving up!!

Keep at it and you will eventually get it right...

ðŸ™‚ Give it a try!! 

What have you got to lose ðŸ¤£
